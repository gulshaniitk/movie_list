Javascript API Assignment

Deployed at : https://gulshaniitk.github.io/movie_list/

Objective: 
Develop a movie list application inspired by IMDB that uses the OMDB
API. The application should allow users to view a list of movies with their posters and
names. It should include pagination for movie lists exceeding 10 entries, a search
text box to find movies directly from the API, and a movie details section that
displays additional information fetched from the API upon clicking a movie.
Additionally, users should be able to provide ratings (out of 5 stars) and comments
for each movie, and this data should be saved in the local storage
